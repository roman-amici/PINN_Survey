# PINN_Survey

A Survey of Physics Informed Neural Network Test Problems, Architectures, and Optimization Techniques, and Visualization Techniques.

## Introduction

This was a library that I built up for research purposes in the Summer of 2020. There may be areas of dead code from failed research directions etc.

The codepaths found in the "Demos" folder should be working, though.

## Installation

This project uses PINN_Base as a git (and python) submodule. To checkout, make sure you use

```
git checkout --recurse-submodules
```

Then install the base module via

```
pip install -e PINN_Base/
```

## Usage

See the Demos folder for further usage examples.
